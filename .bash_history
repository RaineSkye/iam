rspec spec/ave too much cabbage on your hands? Lauren, of the blog Flora & Vino, is sharing this quick pickled cabbage recipe that's the perfect addition to sandwiches, topped over chicken and fish, or eaten straight from the jar for an afternoon snack!

Ingredients
Â½ head purple cabbage, shredded with mandoline slicer
1 c filtered water
1 c apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp maple syrup
Instructions
In a large glass airtight container, combine shredded purple cabbage, apple cider vinegar, filtered water, and maple syrup.
Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours or overnight.
Recipe Notes
A mandoline is a useful kitchen gadget that makes it easy to quickly cut any fruit or veggie into uniform slices. It's a real time saver, but you can just (carefully) use a sharp knife if you don't have one. You can store your pickles in the fridge for up to one month. Try adding red pepper flakes, mustard seeds, and garlic for an extra punch of flavor! If you've still got raw cabbage leftover in your fridge after making this, try making our creamy slaw!
